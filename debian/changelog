  * json: global allocators removal fixup

  * internal: data struct for internal metrics has been changed to std::map from std::unordered_map (because of std::string key)
  * system stats: system stats have been reworked because previous version was not thread-safe
  * chrono: system's cycles frequency estimation fixup (duration delta between system's clock and tsc clock measurements has been increased)

handystats (1.1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * core: enabled flag has been added (measuring points are processed now only if this flag is set)
  * json: memory allocation has been improved (global rapidjson::MemoryPoolAllocator has been replaced with local ones)
  * counter: default values for measuring points has been added (increment +1, decrement -1) counter: new measuring point 'HANDY_COUNTER_CHANGE' has been added (if you don't want to work with increment/decrement measuring points, positive delta values will be treated as increment and negative as decrement)
  * core: sleeping policy has been added in case of empty message queue (sleep interval changes gradually from 1 to 1000 usecs)
