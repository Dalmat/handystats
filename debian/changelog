handystats (1.7.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * measuring_points: measuring points are macros now (can be disabled by defining HANDYSTATS_DISABLE).
  * measuring_points: C interface added (measuring_points headers with .h extension).
  * metrics: attribute metric added.
  * measuring_points: attribute proxy added.
  * measuring_points: attribute's C interface added (only measuring points with specified attribute's value type like HANDY_ATTRIBUTE_SET_UINT).

handystats (1.6.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * metrics: timer's idle timeout mechanics improved.

handystats (1.6.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * json: json writers should take const pointer to const object because writer must not modify it for sure.
  * json: support for writing to buffer and string has been added to timestamp json writer.
  * chrono: handystats::chrono interface has been reworked.
  * metrics: parameters for timer operations have been swapped (timestamp, instance -> instance, timestamp).
  * measuring_points: metric proxies have been added.
  * events, message_queue: event messages throughout the library are handled by std::unique_ptr now (instead of std::shared_ptr).
  * json_dump: json dump is constructed from metrics_dump map (+ dump timestamp)
  * metrics_dump: by now metrics_dump map doesn't contain dump timestamp
  * configuration: json_dump is controlled by metrics_dump ("to-json" boolean parameter)
  * configuration: sleeping on empty message queue parameter removed
    (by now thread sleeps for some small interval and consumes about 10% of single CPU even if there's nothing to do)

handystats (1.5.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * incremental_statistics: internal stats from gauge have been moved out to separate class.
  * metrics: internal stats have been replaced with incremental_statistics (were gauges).
  * configuration: "gauge" section has been renamed to "incremental-statistics".
  * configuration: handystats::config::defaults namespace with default configuration parameters has been added.
  * timer: now metrics::timer is multi-instance timer (it supports multiple simultaneously active instances).
  * json_dump: HANDY_JSON_DUMP() returns const shared_ptr now to forbid user to modify shared_ptr.
  * metrics_dump: metrics dump has been added. This dump is similar to json dump but is in form of std::map data structure with const metrics.
  * configuration: "metrics-dump" section has been added.
  * json_dump: zero json dump interval configuration disables json dump creation.
  * metrics_dump: zero metrics dump interval configuration disables metrics dump creation.
